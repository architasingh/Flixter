# Project 1 - Flixter

Flixter is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
- User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- User can pull to refresh the movie list.
- User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- User can tap a tab bar button to view a grid layout of Movie Posters using a CollectionView.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- Customize the UI.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Collection views were difficult to understand because there was less instructional material that walked us through step-by-step
2. Connecting outlets and setting subclasses  

## Video Walkthrough

Walkthroughs of implemented user stories are attached as separate .gif files in this repo.

## Notes

I struggled with table views and doing the Tumblr lab helped clarify my confusion. I also found collection views to be confusing and think it would be very helpful to get a more in-depth walkthrough on setting them up and connecting outlets.
